    <string name="program1desc">The Starting Strength Novice Program can be broken down into two workout days, Day A and Day B.

        to take into account the adaptations in the body of the lifter.</string>

    <string name="program3">3 Day Split</string>
    <string name="program3desc">A 3 day workout split can be a great way to plan your workout week if you’re pressed for time or don’t
        want to be in the gym 5 times a week. The different variations of a 3 day workout split are arguably amongst the most used by
        gym athletes all around the world.</string>
    <string name="programdesc1">The Starting Strength Program is designed for novice lifters.
    This program takes advantage of \"newbie gains\" by adding 10 pounds to the squat after 2 times it\'s performed,
        15-20 lbs to the deadlift the first couple times, and 10 lbs the next several times it\'s performed.
        For the bench press/shoulder press and the power clean you increment by 5lbs. This program is designed for 3 days a week M/W/F.</string>

    <string name="squatdesc">1. Stand with feet a little wider than hip width, toes facing front.\n
    2. Drive your hips back—bending at the knees and ankles and pressing your knees slightly open—as you…\n
    3. Sit into a squat position while still keeping your heels and toes on the ground, chest up and shoulders back.\n
    4. Strive to eventually reach parallel, meaning knees are bent to a 90-degree angle.\n

    <string name="chinup">Chin-Ups</string>
    <string name="chinupdesc">1. Stand with your arms shoulder-width apart and reach up to grab the overhead bar. Make sure to use an underhand grip — so your palms face toward you.\n
    2. Brace your abdominal muscles to create tension throughout your body — this increases your stability as you move.\n
    3. Pull yourself up from your stationary position until your chin is above the bar. Your legs should remain as still as possible and your neck should be in a neutral position, with your head facing forward.\n
    4. Pause for a moment at the top.\n
    5. Then slowly lower yourself back down. Force yourself to move slowly during this portion to maximize your gains from this exercise. </string>

    <string name="shoulderpdesc">1. Stand with the bar on your front shoulders, and your hands next to your shoulders\n
    2. Press the bar over your head, until it’s balanced over your shoulders and mid-foot\n
    3. Lock your elbows at the top, and shrug your shoulders to the ceiling.</string>
    <string name="clean">Power Cleans</string>
    <string name="cleandesc">Since this is a complicated excercise we will do it in phases.\n
    </string>
    <string name="deadclean">Deadlift/Power Clean</string>
    <string name="deadcleandesc">At this point you’ve become strong enough to pull enough weight that we limit deadlift and cleaning frequency.</string>
