    <string name="program1">Starting Strength</string>
    <string name="program1desc">The Starting Strength Novice Program can be broken down into two workout days, Day A and Day B.
        The entire body is worked each session. As the trainee progresses through the program, Days A and B are slightly modified
        to take into account the adaptations in the body of the lifter.</string>
    <string name="program2">Judo: Beginner Strength</string>
    <string name="program2desc">This beginner program is aimed to build strength for judokas. It is meant to start off with and to progress to the intermediate circuit.</string>
    <string name="program3">3 Day Split</string>
    <string name="program3desc">A 3 day workout split can be a great way to plan your workout week if you’re pressed for time or don’t
        want to be in the gym 5 times a week. The different variations of a 3 day workout split are arguably amongst the most used by
        gym athletes all around the world.</string>
    <string name="programdesc1">The Starting Strength Program is designed for novice lifters.
    This program takes advantage of \"newbie gains\" by adding 10 pounds to the squat after 2 times it\'s performed,
        15-20 lbs to the deadlift the first couple times, and 10 lbs the next several times it\'s performed.
        For the bench press/shoulder press and the power clean you increment by 5lbs. This program is designed for 3 days a week M/W/F.</string>
    <string name="programdesc2">This Judo circuit is made to develop the athlete\'s foundational strength. This is meant for beginner judokas to achieve base strength before moving
        to the intermediate programs. This program is meant to be done in a circuit where each phase is done consecutively for the alloted amount of sets before moving to the next
        phase (excercise 1 then the next excercise in the phase then reset back to excercise 1). After a month then the athlete can move on to the intermediate circuit
    </string>
    <string name="programdesc3">This can be quite effective, especially for beginners, since it allows for plenty of recovery time for the various muscle groups.
        With a traditional beginner 3 day split, you will mostly only be working out a specific muscle group once a week, so that leaves around 7 days of recovery
        for that muscle group. If you are looking for a more advanced workout plan that involves high-volume training, we have the Arnold Split workout plan.</string>

    2. Brace your abdominal muscles to create tension throughout your body — this increases your stability as you move.\n
    3. Pull yourself up from your stationary position until your chin is above the bar. Your legs should remain as still as possible and your neck should be in a neutral position, with your head facing forward.\n
    4. Pause for a moment at the top.\n

    <string name="dowelhingedesc">1. Stand on an incline board.\n
        2.Shift your weight to your heels and push your hips back towards the wall behind you while you hinge forward at the hips. Think about sticking your butt out behind you. As you hinge, the dowel should not lose contact with those three points. If it does, you know you’re doing the move incorrectly.\n
        3. Lower your torso until it’s midway between vertical and parallel to the floor. Pause. Keep a slight bend in your knees during the downward and upward phase.\n

    <string name="shoulderpfromkneedesc">1. Find a stable half kneeling position with the knee at 90 degrees.\n
        2. Start with the dumbbell at the shoulder, with the elbow facing slightly away from the body.\n
        3. Press the dumbbell overhead and lock the elbow to move through the full range of motion.\n

        2. Raise your arms simultaneously just a couple inches out to each side and pause. This momentary pause should help ensure you disengage your trapezius muscle from the movement, targeting the deltoids as intended.\n
        3. Lift the dumbbells up and out to each side, keeping your arms almost completely straight, stopping when your elbows reach shoulder-height and your body is forming a "T" shape. Breathe in as you lift.\n

    <string name="skullcrush">Skull Crushers</string>
    <string name="skullcrushdesc">1. Flex your elbows and lower the weight toward the top of your head. Your upper arms should remain relatively perpendicular to your body. This keeps the tension on the triceps versus shifting it to the shoulders.\n

        4. As you exhale, return to the starting point using a controlled movement. Try not to crash the weights.</string>
    <string name="cablerow">Cable Row</string>
    <string name="cablerowdesc">1. Pull the handle and weight back toward the lower abdomen while trying not to use the momentum of the row too much by moving the torso backward with the arms.\n
        2. Target the middle to upper back by keeping your back straight and squeezing your shoulder blades together as you row, keeping your chest out.\n
        3. Return the handle forward under tension to full stretch, remembering to keep that back straight even though flexed at the hips. Repeat the exercise for the desired number of repetitions.</string>

    <string name="legpress">Leg Press</string>
    <string name="legpressdesc">1. Brace your abdominal muscles and push the platform away with your heels and forefoot. Your heels should remain flat on the footplate. The front of your foot or toes should never be used exclusively to move the pad forward.\n
        2. While exhaling, extend your legs and keep your head and back flat against the seat pad. Extend with slow control rather than with an explosive movement.\n
        3. Pause at the top of the movement. Do not lock out your knees, and ensure that they are not bowing out or in.\n
        4. While inhaling, return the footplate to the starting position by gradually bending the knees. Keep the feet and back flat throughout.\n
        5. If you have never done leg presses, start modestly with three sets of 10 leg presses. You can advance from there as you build strength.</string>
    <string name="legcurl">Leg Curls</string>
    <string name="legcurldesc">1. When doing seated leg curls, the thigh pad should rest just above the knees and the lower leg pad directly below the calf.\n

        2. Rise onto the balls of your feet, as high as you can. Give your calf muscles an extra squeeze at the top.\n
        3. Pause, then lower your heels back down in a slow, controlled motion. (When you go too fast, your Achilles tendon does more work than your calf muscles.)\n
        4. Repeat as desired, maintaining that slow tempo.</string>

    <string name="plankdesc">1. Begin in the plank position, face down with your forearms and toes on the floor. Your elbows are directly under your shoulders and your forearms are facing forward. Your head is relaxed and you should be looking at the floor.\n
        2. Engage your abdominal muscles, drawing your navel toward your spine. Keep your torso straight and rigid and your body in a straight line from your ears to your toes with no sagging or bending. This is the neutral spine position.
